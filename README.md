# Shopping List App Challenge

[Shopping List App](https://orndorfftyler.github.io/shopping-list/)

For this project, I was given HTML and CSS files describing a static shopping list. I wrote some jQuery to allow the user to add new items, delete old items, and "check" items. 

I learned about event delegation by attaching event listeners to the ul element that listen for events on its descendants. This way the app can manipulate HTML elements that aren't present in the original HTML file.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
